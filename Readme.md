# 'Basic' React Boiler Plate


## Start dev with 
npm run dev 
React HMR will be run so as you edit react components they will update in real time. 

## Build Production
If you want to build production, run `npm run build` then `npm start` will start the production environment. 

## Libraries Used
Off the top of my head: 
* React
* Redux
* React-Router 
* Express 
* Mongoose 

## Todo
* Code Splitting
* Vendor Manifest with react, etc to minify size on updates.
